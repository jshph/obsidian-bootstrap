## Installation

### Using Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

The MCP server is available as a pre-built executable in the `dist` folder. This requires the templates directory to be alongside the executable.

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-bootstrap": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/bootstrap-vault/dist/obsidian-bootstrap"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: The `dist` folder contains:
- `obsidian-bootstrap` - The executable MCP server
- `templates/` - Required template files (must be in same directory)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-vault-bootstrap
cd obsidian-vault-bootstrap

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the executable
./build.sh
```

This creates:
- `dist/obsidian-bootstrap` - Compiled executable
- `dist/templates/` - Template files with plugin manifests

### Development Mode

For development, you can run directly with Bun:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-bootstrap": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/bootstrap-vault/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop (Claude Code)

There are two ways to add this MCP server to Claude:

#### Option 1: Project-Scoped (Recommended for sharing)

From your project directory, run:
```bash
cd /path/to/bootstrap-vault
claude mcp add obsidian-bootstrap --scope project "bun run src/index.ts"
```

This creates a `.mcp.json` file in your project root that can be committed to version control.

#### Option 2: User-Scoped (Personal use)

```bash
claude mcp add obsidian-bootstrap --scope user "bun run /path/to/bootstrap-vault/src/index.ts"
```

#### Option 3: Manual Configuration

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-bootstrap": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "src/index.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/bootstrap-vault"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using the MCP Server

Once configured, restart Claude Desktop and you'll see the MCP server is connected.

#### Quick Commands

In Claude Desktop, you can use these commands:

```
Create a PKM vault for personal knowledge management
```

```
Set up a research vault for my PhD thesis
```

```
I need a GTD vault for task management
```

Or use the interactive wizard:
```
Use the bootstrap_vault prompt to help me create a new Obsidian vault
```

Claude will guide you through:
1. Understanding your use case
2. Recommending the best template
3. Creating your vault with plugins pre-installed
4. Setting up folder structure
5. Providing a personalized quick-start guide

#### What Happens Next

After vault creation:
1. Open the vault in Obsidian
2. When prompted about restricted mode, click "Turn off restricted mode"
3. Plugins will be automatically recognized and enabled
4. Start using your pre-configured templates with hotkeys
